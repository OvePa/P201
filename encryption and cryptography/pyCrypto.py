"""
The PyCrypto package is probably the most well known 3rd party cryptography
package for Python. Sadly PyCrypto’s development stopped in 2012. Others have
continued to release the latest version of PyCrypto so we can still get it for
Python 3.5 if we don’t mind using a 3rd party’s binary.

Fortunately there is a fork of the project called PyCrytodome that is a drop-in
replacement for PyCrypto.

You need Python 3.5 for Crypto and PyCrypto

How to install pycryptodome#
To install it for Linux, we can use the following pip command:
pip3 install pycryptodome

Windows is a bit different:
pip3 install pycryptodomex

If we run into issues, it’s probably because we don’t have the right
dependencies installed or we need a compiler for Windows.

Also worth noting is that PyCryptodome has many enhancements over the last
version of PyCrypto. It is well worth our time to visit their home page and see
what new features are.
